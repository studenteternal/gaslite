Gaslite is a first deliverable effort to extend a very limited number of firewall managment functions
into a self serve portal. The specific goal of V1 is to allow the additiona dn removal of IPSEC site to site tunnels.

Web front end:
HTTPS
very-basic user authentication - v2 will intergrate this into LDAP
once logged in a user should see firewalls they can manage and the existing tunnels
user should be able to add a new tunnel or remove an existing one.

backend:
populate the firewall data with a call to the managed firewalls at user login
call to firewall to execute changes
call to firewall to save changes

backend connectivity SHH or REST

V1 supported firewalls will be Vyatta 5400 only

prject plan phase 1:
create target vyatta test platform
#intall ruby on rails dev enviroment
on reflection rails is has too much overhead both technical and human for this project moving code base to FLASK to leverage existing Python Expertise.

phase 2:
create ruby code to poll firewall config
create ruby code to make a change to firewall config

phase 3:
basic front end, create https host and process that calls phase 2 code

phase 4:
add basic user authentication

phase 5:
clean up and make UX relativly painless
